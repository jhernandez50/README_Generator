# Node.js README Generator 

## Description 
It's important to have a quality README with information about the project when creating a Github repository, to explain the users how to use the app and what they should expect from it.

## Functionality

With node.js and Inquirer, I have created an APP that ask for information regarding the README file you need to create.

The application will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```

Once the information is submited, the README file will be created in the utils folder.

## Repository
